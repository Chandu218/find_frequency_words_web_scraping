Word Frequency
Objective
Write a program to fetch a Wikipedia page and report the top n words on that page.
The parameters to the program should be 'page_id' and 'n'.
The URL to fetch a page from Wikipedia is
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&pageids=[PAGE
ID]&explaintext&format=json
(replacing [PAGE ID] with the requested page id).
This returns a JSON object where the page's text is available under query.pages.[PAGE
ID].extract and the title under query.pages.[PAGE ID].title.
The output should look like this (where n = 5 and page_id = 21721040):
URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&pageids=21721040&explaintext
&format=json
Title: Stack Overflow

21 stack, questions
16 overflow
11 that, users

When two or more words have the same frequency include them all on the same line separated
by a comma.
A word is defined as a sequence of at least four alphabetic characters.
Include unit tests and a README describing how to compile (if necessary) and run your
solution.
